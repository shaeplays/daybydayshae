      Hello! This is where I am posting content related to my travels in Paris, London, Brussels, Vienna, Prague, Barcelona, and more. This blog is a work in progress, designed by me (with the help of many internet tutorials, especially @avglinux, and some know-how from my degree). If something on the site doesn't work, I'm so sorry in advance and I appreciate you visiting; please let me know, and I will try my best to fix it, so keep checking back! This blog is open source (hosted on GitHub!) so if you know what you're looking for, you could even tell me how to fix what's not working. Like this blog's title, it will change "day by day" as I post more and play around with design elements. Thank you for being here :) - Shae-Linn
